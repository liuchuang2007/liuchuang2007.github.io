          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>This is a library package that includes the PHP Markdown parser and its
              sibling PHP Markdown Extra with additional features.</p>

          <p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
              allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
              format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>

          <p>"Markdown" is actually two things: a plain text markup syntax, and a
              software tool, originally written in Perl, that converts the plain text
              markup to HTML. PHP Markdown is a port to PHP of the original Markdown
              program by John Gruber.</p>

          </ul>

          <h2>Requirement</h2>

          <p>This library package requires PHP 5.3 or later.</p>

          <p>Note: The older plugin/library hybrid package for PHP Markdown and
              PHP Markdown Extra is still maintained and will work with PHP 4.0.5 and later.</p>

          <p>Before PHP 5.3.7, pcre.backtrack_limit defaults to 100聽000, which is too small
              in many situations. You might need to set it to higher values. Later PHP
              releases defaults to 1聽000聽000, which is usually fine.</p>

          <h2>Usage</h2>

          <p>This library package is meant to be used with class autoloading. For autoloading
              to work, your project needs have setup a PSR-0-compatible autoloader. See the
              included Readme.php file for a minimal autoloader setup. (If you cannot use
              autoloading, see below.)</p>

          <p>With class autoloading in place, putting the 'Michelf' folder in your
              include path should be enough for this to work:</p>

<pre><code>use \Michelf\Markdown;
    $my_html = Markdown::defaultTransform($my_text);
</code></pre>

          <p>Markdown Extra syntax is also available the same way:</p>

<pre><code>use \Michelf\MarkdownExtra;
    $my_html = MarkdownExtra::defaultTransform($my_text);
</code></pre>

          <p>If you wish to use PHP Markdown with another text filter function
              built to parse HTML, you should filter the text <em>after</em> the <code>transform</code>
              function call. This is an example with [PHP SmartyPants][psp]:</p>

<pre><code>use \Michelf\Markdown, \Michelf\SmartyPants;
    $my_html = Markdown::defaultTransform($my_text);
    $my_html = SmartyPants::defaultTransform($my_html);
</code></pre>

          <p>All these examples are using the static <code>defaultTransform</code> static function
              found inside the parser class. If you want to customize the parser
              configuration, you can also instantiate it directly and change some
              configuration variables:</p>

<pre><code>use \Michelf\MarkdownExtra;
    $parser = new MarkdownExtra;
    $parser-&gt;fn_id_prefix = "post22-";
    $my_html = $parser-&gt;transform($my_text);
</code></pre>

          <p>To learn more, see the full list of <a href="https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/configuration/">configuration variables</a>.</p>

          <h3>Usage without an autoloader</h3>

          <p>If you cannot use class autoloading, you can still use <code>include</code> or <code>require</code>
              to access the parser. To load the <code>\Michelf\Markdown</code> parser, do it this way:</p>

<pre><code>require_once 'Michelf/Markdown.inc.php';
</code></pre>

          <p>Or, if you need the <code>\Michelf\MarkdownExtra</code> parser:</p>

<pre><code>require_once 'Michelf/MarkdownExtra.inc.php';
</code></pre>

          <p>While the plain <code>.php</code> files depend on autoloading to work correctly, using the
              <code>.inc.php</code> files instead will eagerly load the dependencies that would be
              loaded on demand if you were using autoloading.</p>

          <h2>Public API and Versioning Policy</h2>

          <p>Version numbers are of the form <em>major</em>.<em>minor</em>.<em>patch</em>.</p>

          <p>The public API of PHP Markdown consist of the two parser classes <code>Markdown</code>
              and <code>MarkdownExtra</code>, their constructors, the <code>transform</code> and <code>defaultTransform</code>
              functions and their configuration variables. The public API is stable for
              a given major version number. It might get additions when the minor version
              number increments.</p>

          <p><strong>Protected members are not considered public API.</strong> This is unconventional
              and deserves an explanation. Incrementing the major version number every time
              the underlying implementation of something changes is going to give
              nonessential version numbers for the vast majority of people who just use the
              parser.  Protected members are meant to create parser subclasses that behave in
              different ways. Very few people create parser subclasses. I don't want to
              discourage it by making everything private, but at the same time I can't
              guarantee any stable hook between versions if you use protected members.</p>

          <p><strong>Syntax changes</strong> will increment the minor number for new features, and the
              patch number for small corrections. A <em>new feature</em> is something that needs a
              change in the syntax documentation. Note that since PHP Markdown Lib includes
              two parsers, a syntax change for either of them will increment the minor
              number. Also note that there is nothing perfectly backward-compatible with the
              Markdown syntax: all inputs are always valid, so new features always replace
              something that was previously legal, although generally nonsensical to do.</p>

          <h2>Bugs</h2>

          <p>To file bug reports please send email to:
              <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#109;&#x69;&#x63;&#104;&#x65;&#108;&#x2e;&#x66;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#x69;&#x6e;&#64;&#x6d;&#105;&#x63;&#x68;&#101;&#x6c;&#102;&#x2e;&#x63;&#97;">&#109;&#x69;&#x63;&#104;&#x65;&#108;&#x2e;&#x66;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#x69;&#x6e;&#64;&#x6d;&#105;&#x63;&#x68;&#101;&#x6c;&#102;&#x2e;&#x63;&#97;</a></p>

          <p>Please include with your report: (1) the example input; (2) the output you
              expected; (3) the output PHP Markdown actually produced.</p>

          <p>If you have a problem where Markdown gives you an empty result, first check
              that the backtrack limit is not too low by running <code>php --info | grep pcre</code>.
              See Installation and Requirement above for details.</p>

          <h2>Development and Testing</h2>

          <p>Pull requests for fixing bugs are welcome. Proposed new features are
              going meticulously reviewed -- taking into account backward compatibility,
              potential side effects, and future extensibility -- before deciding on
              acceptance or rejection.</p>

          <p>If you make a pull request that includes changes to the parser please add
              tests for what is being changed to <a href="https://github.com/michelf/mdtest/">MDTest</a> and make a pull request there
              too.</p>

          <h2>Version History</h2>

          <p>Current Version:</p>

          <ul>
              <li><p>Added a <code>code_span_content_func</code> configuration variable which takes a
                  function that will convert the content of the code span to HTML. This can
                  be useful to implement syntax highlighting. Although contrary to its
                  code block equivalent, there is no syntax for specifying a language.
                  Credits to styxit for the implementation.</p></li>
              <li><p>In the parser code, switched to PHPDoc comment format. Thanks to
                  Robbie Averill for the help.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>PHP Markdown Lib 1.6.0 (23 Dec 2015)</p>

          <p>Note: this version was incorrectly released as 1.5.1 on Dec 22, a number
              that contradicted the versioning policy.</p>

          <ul>
              <li><p>For fenced code blocks in Markdown Extra, can now set a class name for the
                  code block's language before the special attribute block. Previously, this
                  class name was only allowed in the absence of the special attribute block.</p></li>
              <li><p>Added a <code>code_block_content_func</code> configuration variable which takes a
                  function that will convert the content of the code block to HTML. This is
                  most useful for syntax highlighting. For fenced code blocks in Markdown
                  Extra, the function has access to the language class name (the one outside
                  of the special attribute block). Credits to Mario Konrad for providing the
                  implementation.</p></li>
              <li><p>The curled arrow character for the backlink in footnotes is now followed
                  by a Unicode variant selector to prevent it from being displayed in emoji
                  form on iOS.</p>

                  <p>Note that in older browsers the variant selector is often interpreted as a
                      separate character, making it visible after the arrow. So there is now a
                      also a <code>fn_backlink_html</code> configuration variable that can be used to set
                      the link text to something else. Credits to Dana for providing the
                      implementation.</p></li>
              <li><p>Fixed an issue in MarkdownExtra where long header lines followed by a
                  special attribute block would hit the backtrack limit an cause an empty
                  string to be returned.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>PHP Markdown Lib 1.5.0 (1 Mar 2015)</p>

          <ul>
              <li><p>Added the ability start ordered lists with a number different from 1 and
                  and have that reflected in the HTML output. This can be enabled with
                  the <code>enhanced_ordered_lists</code> configuration variable for the Markdown
                  parser; it is enabled by default for Markdown Extra.
                  Credits to Matt Gorle for providing the implementation.</p></li>
              <li><p>Added the ability to insert custom HTML attributes with simple values
                  everywhere an extra attribute block is allowed (links, images, headers).
                  The value must be unquoted, cannot contains spaces and is limited to
                  alphanumeric ASCII characters.
                  Credits to Peter Droogmans for providing the implementation.</p></li>
              <li><p>Added a <code>header_id_func</code> configuration variable which takes a function
                  that can generate an <code>id</code> attribute value from the header text.
                  Credits to Evert Pot for providing the implementation.</p></li>
              <li><p>Added a <code>url_filter_func</code> configuration variable which takes a function
                  that can rewrite any link or image URL to something different.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>PHP Markdown Lib 1.4.1 (4 May 2014)</p>

          <ul>
              <li><p>The HTML block parser will now treat <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> as a block-level element
                  (as it should) and no longer wrap it in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or parse it's content with
                  the as Markdown syntax (although with Extra you can use <code>markdown="1"</code>
                  if you wish to use the Markdown syntax inside it).</p></li>
              <li><p>The content of <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements will now be left alone, its content
                  won't be interpreted as Markdown.</p></li>
              <li><p>Corrected an bug where some inline links with spaces in them would not
                  work even when surounded with angle brackets:</p>

<pre><code>[link](&lt;s p a c e s&gt;)
</code></pre></li>
              <li><p>Fixed an issue where email addresses with quotes in them would not always
                  have the quotes escaped in the link attribute, causing broken links (and
                  invalid HTML).</p></li>
              <li><p>Fixed the case were a link definition following a footnote definition would
                  be swallowed by the footnote unless it was separated by a blank line.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>PHP Markdown Lib 1.4.0 (29 Nov 2013)</p>

          <ul>
              <li><p>Added support for the <code>tel:</code> URL scheme in automatic links.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tel:+1-111-111-1111&gt;
</code></pre>

                  <p>It gets converted to this (note the <code>tel:</code> prefix becomes invisible):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="tel:+1-111-111-1111"&gt;+1-111-111-1111&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre></li>
              <li><p>Added backtick fenced code blocks to MarkdownExtra, originally from
                  Github-Flavored Markdown.</p></li>
              <li><p>Added an interface called MarkdownInterface implemented by both
                  the Markdown and MarkdownExtra parsers. You can use the interface if
                  you want to create a mockup parser object for unit testing.</p></li>
              <li><p>For those of you who cannot use class autoloading, you can now
                  include <code>Michelf/Markdown.inc.php</code> or <code>Michelf/MarkdownExtra.inc.php</code> (note
                  the     <code>.inc.php</code> extension) to automatically include other files required
                  by the parser.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>PHP Markdown Lib 1.3 (11 Apr 2013)</p>

          <p>This is the first release of PHP Markdown Lib. This package requires PHP
              version 5.3 or later and is designed to work with PSR-0 autoloading and,
              optionally with Composer. Here is a list of the changes since
              PHP Markdown Extra 1.2.6:</p>

          <ul>
              <li><p>Plugin interface for WordPress and other systems is no longer present in
                  the Lib package. The classic package is still available if you need it:
                  <a href="https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/classic/">https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/classic/</a></p></li>
              <li><p>Added <code>public</code> and <code>protected</code> protection attributes, plus a section about
                  what is "public API" and what isn't in the Readme file.</p></li>
              <li><p>Changed HTML output for footnotes: now instead of adding <code>rel</code> and <code>rev</code>
                  attributes, footnotes links have the class name <code>footnote-ref</code> and
                  backlinks <code>footnote-backref</code>.</p></li>
              <li><p>Fixed some regular expressions to make PCRE not shout warnings about POSIX
                  collation classes (dependent on your version of PCRE).</p></li>
              <li><p>Added optional class and id attributes to images and links using the same
                  syntax as for headers:</p>

<pre><code>[link](url){#id .class}
    ![img](url){#id .class}
</code></pre>

                  <p>It work too for reference-style links and images. In this case you need
                      to put those attributes at the reference definition:</p>

<pre><code>[link][linkref] or [linkref]
    ![img][linkref]

    [linkref]: url "optional title" {#id .class}
</code></pre></li>
              <li><p>Fixed a PHP notice message triggered when some table column separator
                  markers are missing on the separator line below column headers.</p></li>
              <li><p>Fixed a small mistake that could cause the parser to retain an invalid
                  state related to parsing links across multiple runs. This was never
                  observed (that I know of), but it's still worth fixing.</p></li>
          </ul>
